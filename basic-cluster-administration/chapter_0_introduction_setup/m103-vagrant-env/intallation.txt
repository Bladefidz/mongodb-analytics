Lecture Instructions

From the directory m103-vagrant-env, we can bring up the Vagrant environment:

    vagrant up

After bringing up the environment, we can provision Vagrant (to download datasets, validation scripts, etc.):

    vagrant provision

Once the environment is provisioned, we can connect with ssh:

    vagrant ssh

As you complete labs in this course, you will be asked to run validation scripts that check your work. These validators are stored inside the VM. If you need to re-download these scripts, run the following command (from Vagrant):

    download_validators
