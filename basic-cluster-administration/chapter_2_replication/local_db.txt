Making a data directory and launching a mongod process for a standalone node:

mkdir allbymyselfdb
mongod --dbpath allbymyselfdb

All MongoDB instances start with two default databases, admin and local:

mongo
show dbs

Display collections from the local database (this displays more collections from a replica set than from a standalone node):

use local
show collections

Querying the oplog after connected to a replica set:

use local
db.oplog.rs.find()

Getting information about the oplog. Remember the oplog is a capped collection, meaning it can grow to a pre-configured size before it starts to overwrite the oldest entries with newer ones. The below will determine whether a collection is capped, what the size is, and what the max size is.

Storing oplog stats as a variable called stats:

var stats = db.oplog.rs.stats()

Verifying that this collection is capped (it will grow to a pre-configured size before it starts to overwrite the oldest entries with newer ones):

stats.capped

Getting current size of the oplog:

stats.size

Getting size limit of the oplog:

stats.maxSize

Getting current oplog data (including first and last event times, and configured oplog size):

rs.printReplicationInfo()
